# Database Migrations

This directory contains PostgreSQL migrations for the bounty-challenge database.

## Migration Files

Migrations are numbered sequentially and run in order:

- `001_initial.sql` - Base schema (registrations, bounties, indexes)

## Running Migrations

Migrations are applied automatically when the server starts via `BountyStorage::new()`.

The migration runner:
1. Creates a `schema_migrations` table to track applied migrations
2. Reads all `.sql` files from this directory
3. Sorts by filename (numeric prefix)
4. Runs each migration that hasn't been applied
5. Records the migration version and timestamp

## Creating New Migrations

1. Create a new file: `NNN_description.sql` where NNN is the next number
2. Write idempotent SQL (use `IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.)
3. Add comments explaining the purpose
4. Test locally before deploying

Example:
```sql
-- 002_add_issue_title.sql
-- Add title column for better display

ALTER TABLE validated_bounties ADD COLUMN issue_title TEXT;
```

## Manual Operations

### Check Applied Migrations
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version;"
```

### View Bounty Stats
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT hotkey, COUNT(*) as bounties 
FROM validated_bounties 
GROUP BY hotkey 
ORDER BY bounties DESC;
"
```

### Export Data
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\COPY (SELECT * FROM validated_bounties) TO 'bounties.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;"
```
